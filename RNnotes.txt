Notes from Sp19 CSE 107
Ruth Ng 

- We moved to using gradescope, so we commented out stuff for GitHub organizations that we have been using before. In particular, all the stuff to parse the JSON student info stuff. 
- We upgraded playcrypt to compile with python3. pycrypto does not need to be installed using pip2.7 anymore. Majority of changes are one of the following
	- print needs parenthesis
	- integer divide is // not / 
	- xrange needs to be changed to range
	- function definitions cannot take tuples as arguments. It can parse the tuple in the body of the code though.

- Daniele mentioned something about advantages not being exactly one because of the way things are written. We may be able to fix this?
