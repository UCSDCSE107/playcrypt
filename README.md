# PlayCrypt
PlayCrypt collection of cryptography games and simulators implemented in Python.

For details on how to retrieve, compile and submit homework in the current edition of CSE107, please see the README on Piazza. 

If you have any questions or problems using the playcrypt library, please consult https://avivkiss.github.io/cs107-w16/intro.html for documentation.
The "Conventions" and "Tools" sections are probably the most useful for your purposes.
Please ignore the "Getting Started" section on that website, and instead consult the "Getting Started" section above.
Please also note that the links to piazza and email are for past years and therefore wrong.
Finally, we have updated certain parts of the playcrypt library, including updating it to work with python 3. So there may be minor differences between the documentation and the playcrypt code.
